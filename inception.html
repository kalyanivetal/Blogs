<b>Story:</b>
	<br><p>
	Leo DiCaprio and his team is hired, by Ken Watanabe to plant the idea in Cilian Murphy's head to break up his empire. What Leo's team doesn't know is that Leo's former wife Mario Cotillard haunts his dreams, as <i>SPOILERS</i> he planted the idea that their world wasn't real, after he spent close to 30-40 years with her in the Limbo stage. This idea possessed her, until she thought that the real world was also a dream world, and killed herself. He feels guilty and allows himself to be haunted by Cotillard's projection in his dreams. <br> Leo and his team succeed in their task. Whether the end is still a dream or reality, is up to the viewer. The thing that matters is that Leo is back with his children, whose faces he could not see throughout the whole film, due to his guilt, and he doesn't care if its a dream or reality, in the end.</p><br>
