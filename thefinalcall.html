	<p>The story runs around Arjun Rampal as Captain Sachedev who was previously pilot for Fighter aeroplanes but later due to consequences his behaviour he resigned from that job and started working as pilot in Indian  Airlines.

	What I liked most in the series is that ETC Kiran Mirza who is mother of the co-pilot died on the plane. She gets to know this on first call with Captain but still she handles the case and kept on talking with Captain and doing her Work. She lost her one and only one son and her courage to handle the case without having a single drop of tears is Salutable. Mr. Krishmurthy tells singhania by looking at his <i>Kundali</i> said he is also going to die in next 4 hrs then for confirmation he also checked Dhruv's <i> Kundali </i> there also he saw same. Sarah asks Krishnamurthy to check whether her book will publish or not and there she gets to know about its not going to but she gets to know one more thing that she will meet one person today and that will change her life.<br>
	At the end of series I understood that it's about forgiveness as not keep burdon on ourselves and living our life the way we desire to and not others want it for them. Not letting your personal things keep impact on professional carrier. Its about Living life nothing else.
	<br> What I didnt understood is that as the plane crash lands How Mr.Singhania is Still alive although it was written in his <i>Kundali</i> that he will die after four hours. Later he takes the place of Krishnamurthy and walks on his Path.
	<br><br>
	<b>THE FINAL CALL is a study of desire, destiny, humanity and spirituality through the vulnerability of a disturbed pilot. Committed to its spiritual undercurrents and the requirements of thrills ends on a spiritual high and transcends the digital web series/movie genre to a new high.</b>
